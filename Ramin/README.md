* Sit together to walk through the intro

## Fase 2
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter to tell something about Ramin
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter to tell something about Your skills
* Make use of Angularjs
* make use of Javascript Source maps

## Fase 3
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter where you make use of Three js to create an animation for the Raminzr eye
* Make use of shaders to shade the eye logo while scrolling down

## Fase 4
* Connect your phone for navigating through the website Websockets.

##Goal
=======
Using advanced CSS techniques.

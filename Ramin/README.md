#Overall Goals
- be clear (clean/readable)
- follow best practices
- follow standards when possible
- respect the Web


#Case 1
=======
Create a version of www.rmnzr.com. where the eye logo is styled using CSS.
* It should be animating (some form of intro)
* The parts should be drawn on a canvas/ (with) svg
* Parallax scrolling

## Fase 1
* start using CSS3 (Sass) to draw the logo
* use CSS transforms and animations for the intro. What kind of animation is all up to you but it has to be flashy.
* Sit together to walk through the intro

## Fase 2
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter to tell something about Ramin
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter to tell something about Your skills
* Make use of Angularjs
* make use of Javascript Source maps

## Fase 3
* Add a parallax scrolling chapter where you make use of Three js to create an animation for the Raminzr eye
* Make use of shaders to shade the eye logo while scrolling down

## Fase 4
* Connect your phone for navigating through the website



##Goal
Using advanced CSS techniques. Create an animating landing page using only CSS.

# The TOC-TP TOOL Web Project
--------
Web application prorted from my old Flex Application, The goal is to redevelop an Webbased version of the Flex Application.

# About TOC
- TOC applies the methods used by the “hard” sciences to understand and manage the material world of human-based systems including the lives of individuals and organizations.
- TOC comprises a methodology for solving problems and implementing the solution found.

##  Which System is more complex?

## What the definition of a problem?
- The traditional definition of a problem is a source of perplexity, distress or irritation.
- The TOC/hard science definition of a problem is a conflict between two conditions/observations. (A basic belief in science is that conflicts do not exist in reality; i.e., something is wrong in our understanding.)

## The Thinking Processes (TP) of TOC
    Tools that enable us to use logic to gain an understanding of our reality and then to find ways of improving it.
    
## Basic Constructs of the TOC TP
- Causality: "If...then..."
    - If.."I get burned" then.."I touch a hot stove."
    - If.."I don't get burned" then.. "I thouch a hot stove 'and' I am wearing an oven mitt."

- Necessity: "In order to...I must..."
    - In order to.. "Avoid getting burned" I must "Do not touch a hot stove" 'becuase' "Touching a hot stove will burn me."

###  PROCESS OF ONGOING IMPROVEMENT
    No matter what the subject matter, accelerated improvement involves answering the following questions
- What to change?
    - Identify the core conflict or problem (the constraint).
- To what to change?
    - Construct a complete solution.
- How to cause a change?
    - Devise plans for implementing the solution and achieving buy-in where necessary.
